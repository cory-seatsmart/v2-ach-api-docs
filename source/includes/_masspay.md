# Mass payments

Dwolla mass payments allows you to easily send up to 5,000 payments one API request. The payments are funded from a single user's specified funding source and processed asynchronously upon submission.

<ol class = "alerts">
    <li class="alert icon-alert-info">
      Dwolla Mass Payments are meant for batches of multiple payments. If you are initiating a single payment to a singular Customer, we recommend using our [/transfers endpoint](/#initiate-a-transfer).
  </li>
</ol>

Your mass payment will initially be pending and then processed.  As the service processes your mass payment, each `item` is processed one after the other, at a rate between 0.5 sec. - 1 sec. / item.  Therefore, you can expect a 1000-item mass payment to be completed between 8-16 minutes.

A mass payment offers a significant advantage over repeatedly calling the [Transfers](#transfers) endpoint for each individual transaction. A key benefit is that a bank-funded mass payment only incurs a single ACH debit from the bank account to fund the entire batch of payments.  The alternative approach will incur an ACH debit from the bank funding source for each individual payment.  Those who used this approach have reported incurring fees from their financial institutions for excessive ACH transactions.

## Initiate a mass payment

This section covers how to initiate a mass payment from your Dwolla Master [Account](#accounts) or Verified [Customer](#customers) resource. A mass payment contains a list of `items` representing individual payments. Optionally, mass payments can contain `metadata` and a `correlationId` on the mass payment itself as well as items contained in the mass payment, which can be used to pass along additional information with the mass payment and item respectively. If a `correlationId` is included on a mass payment item it will be passed along to the transfer created from the item and can be searched on.

### Prevent duplicate mass payment with idempotency key

To prevent an operation from being performed more than once, Dwolla supports passing in an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique key as the value. Multiple `POSTs` with the same idempotency key won't result in multiple resources being created.

For example, if a request to initiate a mass payment fails due to a network connection issue, you can reattempt the request with the same idempotency key to ensure that only a single mass payment is created.

Refer to our [idempotency key](#idempotency-key) section to learn more.

### Deferred mass payment

A mass payment can be created with a status of `deferred`, which allows you to create the mass payment and defer processing to a later time. To trigger processing on a deferred mass payment, you'll [update the mass payment](#update-a-mass-payment) with a status of `pending`. A deferred mass payment can be cancelled by updating the mass payment with a status of `cancelled`.

Allowing businesses to include additional details about the transaction—such as invoice numbers—provides their end users with more information about the transaction in the comfort of their own banking application.

## Retrieve a mass payment

This section outlines how to retrieve a mass payment by its id. All mass payments will have a status of `pending` upon creation and will move to `processing` and finally `complete` as the service runs. It is recommended that you retrieve your [list of mass payment items](#list-items-for-a-mass-payment) when your mass payment has a status of `complete` to determine if any items failed to process successfully.

### HTTP request

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/mass-payments/{id}`

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type   | Description                                             |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| id        | yes      | string | The id of the mass payment to retrieve information for. |

### HTTP status and error codes

| HTTP Status | Code     | Description             |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------|
| 404         | NotFound | Mass payment not found. |

## List items for a mass payment

A mass payment contains a list of payments called `items`. An `item` is distinct from the transfer which it creates. An item can contain a status of either `failed`, `pending`, or `success` depending on whether the payment was created by the Dwolla service or not. A mass payment item status of `success` is an indication that a transfer was successfully created. A mass payment's items will be returned in the `_embedded` object as a list of `items`.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/mass-payments/{id}/items`

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type    | Description                                      |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| id        | yes      | string  | Mass payment unique identifier.                  |
| limit     | no       | integer | How many results to return. Defaults to 25.      |
| offset    | no       | integer | How many results to skip.                        |
| status    | no       | string  | Filter results on item status. Possible values: `failed`, `pending`, and `success`. Values delimited by `&status=` (i.e. - `/items?status=failed&status=pending`). |

### Mass payment item failures

Individual mass payment items can have a status of `failed`. If an item has a status of `failed`, an `_embedded` object will be returned within the item which contains a list of `errors`. Each error object includes a top-level error `code`, a `message` with a detailed description of the error, and a `path` which is a JSON pointer to the specific field in the request that has a problem. You can utilize both the failure code and message to get a better understanding of why the particular item failed.

| Code                    | Message               | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| InsufficientFunds     | "Insufficient funds." | The `source` funding source has insufficient funds, and as a result failed to create a transfer. |
| Invalid     | "Receiver not found."   | The `destination` was not a valid Customer or Funding Source. |
| Invalid    | "Receiver cannot be the owner of the source funding source." | The `destination` of the transfer cannot be the same as the `source`.  |
| RequiresFundingSource | "Receiver requires funding source."  | The `destination` of the mass payment item does not have an active funding source attached.  |
| Restricted | "Receiver restricted." | The `destination` customer is either `deactivated` or `suspended` and is not eligible to receive funds. |

### HTTP status and error codes

| HTTP Status | Code      | Description                                |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 403         | Forbidden | Not authorized to list mass payment items. |
| 404         | NotFound  | Mass payment not found.                    |
